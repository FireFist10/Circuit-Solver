# Circuit-Solver
Solves circuit, for given data input based on labeled directed-graph of the circuit.
Code automatically generates [A] matrix as well as [Ge] (admittance) matrix using Re data, [Ise] and [Vse] matrix,
and thus calculates and display current in each element and voltage across each element.
Code does not work for R = 0 for any element, as of now.

Download required version and use it to solve circuits with 
ease of not entering data for every matrix and doing tedious matrix algebra.

## VERSION 1
This code takes input in command line and gives result. 
Works with no limit on number of elements.

## GUI version
This takes GUI input for element properties. Works only up to 8 elements as of now
due to window size constraints.
